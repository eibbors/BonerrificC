Sexy color scheme for **Sublime Text** and **Textmate** that inspires boners of gargantuan magnitude. 

## Installation

Stick it **deep** into your Sublime Text 2 Packages folder, preferably your User folder, but you're free to explore alternative options. Whatever floats your boat...

## About

The theme's color scheme was mostly inspired by two of my all time favorites, Text Ex Machina and Coal Graal, with a dash of Monokai's warmth to offset their cooler colors. I basically just applied the "background at a low opacity" effect to a remix of their palletes. I loved what came out so much I thought I'd share it with the world.

## Problems?

If you stumble upon any hideousness in your favorite language, I'd be happy to fix that for you. Suggestions on how the scheme could be improved are welcome and encouraged. 

Thank you and good night,
